// scholarshipMailer sends the two emails the funnel needs: the applicant's own
// copy of their test link, and the staff alert.
//
// It is a separate type from the enquiry mailer because it sends to a recipient
// the request supplies, not only to a fixed internal list — which is a
// different risk profile and worth keeping visibly apart. Configuration reuses
// the same SMTP_* environment as every other mail path; with SMTP_HOST unset it
// is disabled and the link is logged instead, so local development never sends
// real email and a missing config degrades the notice rather than the funnel.
//
// The applicant's mail carries a link, never a password. A newly provisioned
// account is created with a random secret nobody is told, and the candidate
// sets their own via the existing password-reset flow — so an intercepted email
// yields at most a time-boxed test link, never a durable credential.
