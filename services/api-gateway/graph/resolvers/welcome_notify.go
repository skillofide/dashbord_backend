// userMailer sends a new account its own login details.
//
// Configuration is entirely by environment and shared with every other mailer
// in the gateway (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_FROM). With
// SMTP_HOST unset the mailer is disabled: the account is still created and the
// generated password is still returned to the admin, but nothing is emailed and
// the fact is logged. So a local database never sends real mail, and a missing
// relay degrades the welcome rather than the account creation.
//
// The message is plain text on purpose. A credentials email that arrives as a
// styled HTML card reads like phishing — exactly the reflex we want a new user
// NOT to have about the one mail that carries their password — and plain text
// also survives the corporate filters that strip HTML wholesale.
